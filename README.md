# Git-Fork-Sync-Py
GitHub Fork Sync is a Python script that automatically updates your forked repositories on GitHub by syncing them with their upstream counterparts. The script checks for changes in the original repositories and updates the corresponding forks accordingly. It supports multiple repositories and directly uses the GitHub API.
